# Alpha-Bet
Bingo Themed, Web App , Created with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery

Version 1

Alpha Bet is a Web Application I created in order to brush up on my html, css, and javascript skills.
This version makes extensive use of a javascript via jQuery in order to create a dyanamic interface. 

My end Goal is to incorporate this into a database backend.
Create Highscore DB table, an Accounts Table, and augment the main gameplay with multiplayer functionality. 

Alpha-Bet is a game in which the user picks a position out of a grid of choices. 
The User guess both a the location of the next letter, and the letter.

Version 1. Automatically makes the user guess The correct next letter.
But Different versions, or different game modes will play by different rules. 

Here is a video of the Gameplay:

Note the grey column highlights that automatically detect
the location of user input.
